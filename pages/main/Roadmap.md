### Planned for upcomming Releases
* bugfixing, in particular in {{XLBasicComponents}}: 
	* Excel 2007, Excel 2010 etc. applies a new check to Excelsheets which cause some problems with the Excel data validation that is used in the Dodoni.net library
	* the ExcelPoolInspector is slow and crashes often
* update document for Excel-AddIn
* infrastructure for market data, for example yield curve bootstrapping (~~single~~ and multi-curve approach) etc.
* pricing and valuation engine
* Heston model (semi-analytical and Monte-Carlo)
* simple Inflation/yield curve model (risk-neutral and real-world), perhaps a market model
