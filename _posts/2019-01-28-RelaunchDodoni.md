After a long period of inactivity the Dodoni.net project was relaunched.

* Migration of code and documentation from codeplex.com to github.com 
* Change license to MIT license
* Most of the assemblies are now based on .net Standard.
* change versioning scheme
* The wrapper for the following libraries has been migrated, but:
  - Yeppp!: last change on https://bitbucket.org/MDukhan/yeppp was 2016, official homepage is down.
  - LibM: is still active on https://developer.amd.com/amd-cpu-libraries/amd-math-library-libm/, but available for Ubuntu only; one may think about a wrapper for OpenLibm instead
  - ACML (AMD Core Math Library): state unclear
